Summary – Notification Service Requirements
Functional Goals

Keep the service simple and easy to use for a wide range of users.

Focus on a well-defined set of core features to ensure usefulness.

Additional features can be added later once the initial system is stable.

Design Approach

Design as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Use loosely coupled components to allow:

Easy addition of new functionality

Adaptation to user feedback and evolving business needs

Non-Functional Implications

A clear feature scope helps optimize performance, scalability, and reliability.
